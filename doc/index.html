								<h3><em>22.12.2025 &nbsp;</em>animations for nav bar items and virtual keyboard</h3>
								<ul>
									<li style="margin-top:1em">
									   Bringing the virtual keyboard to life with dynamic, responsive keycap press and release animations.
									</li>
									<li style="margin-top:1em">
									   Every nav bar item now stretches and snaps back like a rubber band when clicked, giving clear visual feedback — Run, Reset, Keyboard, etc. 
									</li>
									<li style="margin-top:1em">
									   Fixed an issue on iPhone where the app could reload due to memory limits when browsing many snapshot or workspace entries. We now use &lt;img&gt; instead of &lt;canvas&gt; elements to reduce memory usage.
									</li>
									<li style="margin-top:1em">
									   Good news! Apple addressed our October bug report — Safari 26.2 now plays nicely with a fully optimized vAmigaWeb again. Our workaround (see below) can soon be retired.
									</li>
								</ul>

								<h3><em>03.10.2025 &nbsp;</em>automatic healing of broken Safari26 apps</h3>
								<ul>
									<li style="margin-top:1em">
									We identified the issue as being related to the LinkerFlags used in the vAmigaCore builds.<br><br> Specifically, the -O3 optimization flag was interfering with exception handling in Safari 26.0, leading to unexpected behavior. <a href="https://github.com/vAmigaWeb/vAmigaWeb/issues/307" target="_blank">learn more</a>.<br><br>
To resolve this, we’ve downgraded the optimization level to -O2, which maintains a high level of performance while ensuring compatibility with Safari 26.0.<br><br>
To restore functionality for broken vAmigaWeb apps, we’ve implemented an automatic upgrade mechanism. When an app starts up and detects that it was built with a version older than 4.3.1 (the first version using -O2), it will trigger an update automatically to fix the issue.</li>
									
								</ul>

								<h3><em>23.09.2025 &nbsp;</em>Apples latest Safari 26.0 crashes vAmigaWeb</h3>
								<ul>
									<li style="margin-top:1em">
									Apples latest Safari 26.0 breaks the faster and more efficient native wasm-exceptions used in vAmigaWeb which we used for the 3 years. We fixed this by downgrading to the slower javascript exception implementation until apple fixes its browser.
									</li>
									<li style="margin-top:1em">
									<i><b>instructions</b></i>
										<ul>
											<li>as Safari 26.0 can not start the vAmigaWeb app at all that means that also the upgrade workflow is broken ...</li>
											<li>You have to open a private safari tab and add the app to the dock again or in case of iPadOS add it to the home screen again</li>
											<li>when apple bug fixes its Safari in version 26.1 then the previous broken vAmigaWeb apps should work again and you get access to your saved snapshot and workspace data</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>

								<h3><em>08.08.2025 &nbsp;</em>upgraded to vAmigaCore 4.3</h3>
								<ul>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									<b>Bug Fixes:</b> fixed some rare issues related to folder import and export.<br> 
								</li>
								</ul>

								<h3><em>09.06.2025 &nbsp;</em>exporting Amiga hard disk to folder (vAmigaCore 4.2.1)</h3>
								<ul>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									export of Amiga hard disks filesystem to folder is now supported.<br> 
								</li>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									The addition of folder import and export functionality allows us to completely transition to using ZIP archives in place of HDF files.<br><br>
									<i>This means you can now both - import and export Amiga hard drives as folders, which is much more convenient than using HDF files—especially when transferring files to and from the host operating system.</i> 
								</li>								
								</ul>

								<h3><em>29.05.2025 &nbsp;</em>importing folders to Amiga hard disk (vAmigaCore 4.2)</h3>
								<ul>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									full ZIP archive extraction to an Amiga hard disk is now supported.<br> 
								</li>								
								</ul>

								<h3><em>27.05.2025 &nbsp;</em>importing large files (vAmigaCore 4.1.2)</h3>
								<ul>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									you can now import any files of any size (e.g. large .lha files) <br> 

vAmigaWeb checks the file size and when

<div style="margin-top:1em;padding-left: 1em;">
<b>below 1.71MB</b> - it will copy the file into a floppy disk which has the advantage of not having to power off the Amiga
<br>
<b>above 1.71 MB</b> - it will create a hard drive disk and copy the file into it ...attaching that hard disk needs the Amiga to reset
</div>
<div style="margin-top: 1em">this is done automatically without interaction and the user is prompted only for the drive number to use</div>
								</li>

								</ul>

								<h3><em>13.05.2025 &nbsp;</em>vAmigaCore v4.1.1</h3>
								<ul>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									this fixes a bug related to RTC emulation (Real Time Clock)
								</li>
								</ul>

								<h3><em>04.05.2025 &nbsp;</em>more chipset infos and vAmigaCore v4.1</h3>
								<ul>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									more infos about selected AGNUS and DENISE chip models in the settings
								</li>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									now shipping with the latest Aros Roms (from Feb. 2025)
								</li>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									fixed various bugs which led to a muted vAmigaCore
								</li>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									vAmigaWeb is now based on the latest vAmigaCore v4.1
								</li>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									bugfix for ECS AGNUS in the DDF logic that could mess up bitplane DMA
								</li>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									bugfix for a HAM drawing bug
								</li>

								</ul>




								<h3><em>12.03.2025 &nbsp;</em>workspaces and vAmigaCore v4.0</h3>
								<ul>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									Workspaces contain used floppies, hard drives, settings, and any selected zip archive. 
								</li>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									Workspaces remain always compatible when vAmigaWeb is upgraded to a newer vAmigaCore version, unlike snapshots, which may become incompatible.
								</li>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									A workspace browser that lets you manage, flag, filter and export your workspaces.
								</li>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									Snapshots are saved with LZ4 compression which results in smaller files and faster compression. 
								</li>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									vAmigaWeb is now based on the latest vAmigaCore v4.0
								</li>
								</ul>

								<h3><em>15.11.2024 &nbsp;</em>runAhead, vSync, slow motion and vAmigaCore v3.0</h3>
								<ul>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									supports <b>run ahead</b>, which is an effective technique to reduce input lag.
									<div style="margin-top:1em">
									run ahead is an emulation technique that essentially pre-computes the emulation a few frames ahead. When the user makes an input, the emulation can immediately respond by adjusting the pre-computed frames accordingly, thus reducing the perceived input delay.
									</div>
								</li>
	
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									For a smoother video output, consider enabling the new <b><span>vSync</span></b> option. <b>vSync</b> synchronizes the emulation with your display’s refresh rate, resulting in smoother visuals by adjusting the Amiga's emulation speed to match the monitor’s refresh rate.
									When selected a new speed icon appears next to the fast forward symbol, functioning as both a speed indicator and a button to go back to the original refresh rate of an Amiga.
								</li>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									<b>Slow motion gaming</b>. The new speed setting also offers speeds below 100%. They are ideal to kick in a slow motion effect on fast paced games. From now on no AI enemy can beat your hero when playing at 50% the speed ;-). matrix effect.
								</li>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									for wider screens the activity monitor switch has been added to the top icon bar
								</li>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									vAmigaWeb is now based on the latest vAmigaCore v3.0
								</li>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									a new css grid based navbar has been implemented. It offers a much better responsive behaviour compared to the old one.
								</li>
								</ul>

								<h3><em>05.10.2024 &nbsp;</em>warp indicator and fast forward icon</h3>
								<ul>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									a fast-forward icon has been added next to the play/pause symbol, functioning as both a warp indicator and a button to accelerate the emulation.
								</li>
								</ul>

								<h3><em>18.08.2024 &nbsp;</em>EmuTOS and action button management</h3>
								<ul>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									support for .ST disks
								</li>	
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									EmuTOS as another free kickstart replacement option in kickstart dialog	
								</li>	
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									option to create and select groups of action buttons only manually by the user which turns off the current automatic which was optimized for single game floppy disks. 
								</li>
								</ul>

								<h3><em>31.05.2024 &nbsp;</em>activity monitors and DMA bus visualisation</h3>
								<ul>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									when 'activity monitors' setting is enabled,  it will show the Amiga chipset activity (e.g. workload of copper or blitter coprocessors)
								</li>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									tap on a specific monitor adds more detailed DMA bus activity visualisation for a specific Amiga chip (aka dma debugger)
								</li>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
								 tap again and dma channel visualisation on that particular DMA channel is turned off
								</li>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
								<i>coming soon:</i> splitted read / write CPU workload monitors for various memory types
								</li>

								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									added pencil support: the app is now usable with a pencil (e.g. Apple Pencil)
								</li>
	
								</ul>

								<h3><em>13.05.2024 &nbsp;</em>iOS / iPadOS - reconnect audio device after longer suspension</h3>
								<ul>
								<li style="margin-top:1em">
									after reviving from longer app background suspension AudioContext got stuck on resuming and reported <i>"Failed to start the audio device" </i><br>
									when this happens we now close the broken AudioContext and create a new one, which brings audio back :-)
								</li>
								</ul>

								<h3><em>12.02.2024 &nbsp;</em>vAmigaWeb v2.6, improved file usage</h3>
									<ul>
									<li style="margin-top:1em">
										imports previously unmountable files on a disk (DD/HD 880KB/1.76MB), e.g. single files such as <i>demo.lha (<a href="https://youtu.be/cDXI1ioQ8zU" target="blank">watch</a>), todos.txt, space_ship.iff, blitter_force.asm</i>
									</li>
									<li style="margin-top:1em">

									<li>
										adjustable key stroke feedback sounds (different sounds for different types of keys)
									</li>
									<li>
										optional key stroke vibration feedback (on devices that support vibration API)
									</li>
									<li>
										adjustable transparency of the keyboard when using the host device in landscape, so that you can see the whole Amiga screen even if the virtual keyboard is on top of it
									</li>	
									</ul>
								<h3><em>03.01.2024 &nbsp;</em>reworked virtual keyboard, improved xbox controller analogue sticks</h3>
								<p>
									the virtual keyboard has been restyled and technically reworked. It is now css grid based which allows for automatic scaling on different screen sizes. Besides a scaling factor the user can now add a margin to the bottom. This is especially useful to not let the keyboard interfere with the home indicator (this is is the thin bar that sits at the bottom of the iPhone screen).
									<br><br>
									all analogue sticks on a external controller should be recognized and work properly now. Tested with wireless xbox controller on iPad.
									<br><br>
</p>
								<h3><em>12.09.2023 &nbsp;</em>covers iPhone notch and dynamic island, redesigned virtual joystick and keyboard mappings </h3>
								<p>
									the screen space around the notch and the dynamic island on modern iPhones is perfectly usable now.
									<br><br>
									redesigned the virtual touch joystick with various different selectable types and a configurable deadzone.
									<br><br>
define your own custom key board mappings even for non Amiga keys <br><i>e.g. Meta+S => save snapshot, Meta+R => restore snapshot, Alt+J => swap joystick ports</i> 
</p>

								<h3><em>31.07.2023 &nbsp;</em> wake lock and fullscreen feature</h3>
								<p>
added a setting to prevent dimming or auto off on supported browsers... very useful for viewing demos
<br><br>
added a fullscreen button to the menu bar on supported browsers
</p>

							<h3><em>09.07.2023 &nbsp;</em>increased .adf compatibility, borderless bug fix </h3>
							<p style="margin-bottom:0px">
								<li>more ADF files are recognized now </li>
								<br>
								<li>when going borderless one vertical pixel was missing when it was an odd number of pixel lines. We fixed that.</li>
								<br>
							</p>


							<h3><em>12.03.2023 &nbsp;</em>support for real BT / USB mouse on iPadOS</h3>
							<p style="margin-bottom:0px">
								despite the built in basic mouse support in iPadOS, Apple decided not to implement the <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=pointerlock">pointerlock API</a> which provides raw movements of the mouse. 
								<br><br>A fallback detection has been built into vAmigaWeb to nevertheless please the user experience.
								<br><br>
								When you select mouse … it will now detect the abscence of the pointerlock API and therefore it will activate the fallback implementation… which works quite satisfying for us
								<br><br>
							</p>

							<h3><em>05.03.2023 &nbsp;</em>support for iPadPro ProMotion display and iOS16 bugfixes</h3>
							<p style="margin-bottom:0px">
								<ul style="margin-top:0.5em">
								<li>iPadPro ProMotion displays with variable refresh rates were capped to 30fps <span style="font-size:smaller">(this was due to a bug in safaris webgl API)</span>, completely removed sdl2 API for this bug and implemented native webgl2 rendering code which lets these displays now run PAL at 50Hz or NTSC at 60Hz</li>
								<li>iPadOS/iOS 16 specific bugfixes for audio demuting and port1/2 selection listbox ...</li>
								<li>fixed sound leaking when running in a hidden firefox tab</li>
								</ul>
							</p>


								<h3><em>07.01.2023 &nbsp;</em>vAmigaWeb v2.3</h3>
								<p style="margin-bottom:0px">
								fixed a bug when system muted the audio while app was being longer suspended in background, now resuming audio context on any user action<br><br>

								upgraded to the release version of vAmigaCore 2.3 which<br>
								<ul style="margin-top:0.5em">

<br><br>
support for 68030 CPU has been removed because the MMU project has been put on hold  <br><span style="font-size:smaller">(use 68020 instead, v3.0b1 has been canceled and major version is reverted back to 2)</span> 
<br><br>

<br><br>
</p>
								<h3><em>12.05.2022 &nbsp;</em>vAmigaWeb v2.0</h3>
								<p style="margin-bottom:0px">
vAmigaCore has been updated to final version v2.0
<br><br>
various reported issues (via github thanks for reporting) have been resolved in this version, most notably these are:
<br><br>
the <b>virtual keyboard</b> forwards now the <b>exact duration of a key press</b> to the Amiga <i>(before duration was a fixed value of 100ms)</i> 
... thanks to this games which rely on <b>long</b> keyboard presses like flight simulation "F/A18 Interceptor" do work now using solely the virtual keyboard
... the duration of the key press is animated with a nice background <b>white LED glow effect</b>
<br><br>
technically spoken the virtual keyboard has been freed from default gestures which were often conflicting (e.g. text selection, drag and drop, context menu popup gesture) 
<br><br>
on <b>touch screens</b> the virtual keyboard has got the following three different touch implementations which can be selected in the settings dialog.
<div style="margin-left:10px;margin-top:5px;font-style:italic">
<b>exact timing</b>
autorepeat and simultaneous keycap presses (disables default scroll gestures on keycaps, scroll gesture possible only on gaps around the keys) 
<br>

<b>smartphone like</b>
native scroll gestures on keycaps (press starts after finger is lifted from keycap for a duration of 100ms) 
<br>

<b>mix of both</b>
 tries to mix both worlds... i.e. exact timing and simultaneous presses but also scrolls keyboard when swiping the finger on keycaps. disadvantage: also does a keypress when only scrolling was intended 
</div>

								</p>



								<h3><em>25.04.2022 &nbsp;</em>vAmigaWeb v2.0 Beta 4</h3>
								<p>
vAmigaCore has been updated to latest beta4
<br><br>
regarding the automatic detection of the display area there is now a new <b>borderless</b> strategy available:
<br><br>
the already existing auto strategy was renamed to <b>viewport tracking</b>: in fact what it does is to set the visible area to exactly the viewport coordinates which the amiga hardware was set to by the current running amiga software or game. Often amiga game designers opened a very large viewport but only were drawing to a much smaller area which resulted despite the enabled automatic viewport tracking into a screen with lot space wasted for borders. E.g. Monkey Island series, and others…
<br>
<br>

to get also rid of these „inner viewport“ borders the new <b>borderless</b> strategy has been implemented:<br>
it examines the screen buffer every 500ms and tries to detect borders by analysing the pixels of the current amiga screen from the edges onwards... it consequently cuts off all same color pixels … when it detects some bigger larger screens (during the calibration process) then it will retain these larger screen sizes ... until the game or software sets other viewport sizes in amiga hardware ... in other words it always looks for the largest drawn picture on the screen and will stick to this largest display area size ... resulting after a couple of seconds in an optimal screen size for devices with smaller screens (e.g. phones or small tablets) 
<br>
<br>

a bug concerning diskswap delay which prevented some games from detecting diskschange has been fixed

<br>
<br>
on android devices the top status bar and the bottom navbar are hidden now by setting display to fullscreen in the PWAs manifest file, which is parsed at installation time. (hope that this was a good decision, if not open a github issue)
